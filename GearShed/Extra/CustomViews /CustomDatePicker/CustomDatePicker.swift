/**
 * This component shows a date picker very similar to Apple's SwiftUI 2.0 DatePicker, but with a difference.
 * Instead of just allowing a single date to be picked, the CustomDatePicker also allows the user to select
 * a set of non-contiguous dates or a date range. It just depends on how this View is initialized.
 *
 * init(singleDay: Binding<Date> [,options])
 *      A single-date picker. Selecting a date de-selects the previous selection. Because the binding
 *      is a Date, there is always a selected date.
 *
 * init(anyDates: Binding<[Date]>, [,options])
 *      Allows multiple, non-continguous, dates to be selected. De-select a date by tapping it again.
 *      The binding array may be empty or it will be an array of dates selected in ascending order.
 *
 * init(dateRange: Binding<ClosedRange<Date>?>, [,options])
 *      Selects a date range. Tapping on a date marks it as the first date, tapping a second date
 *      completes the range. Tapping a date again resets the range. The binding will be nil unless
 *      two dates are selected, completeing the range.
 *
 * optional parameters to init() functions are:
 *  - includeDays: .allDays, .weekdaysOnly, .weekendsOnly
 *      Days not selectable are shown in gray and not selected.
 *  - minDate: Date? = nil
 *      Days before minDate are not selectable.
 *  - maxDate: Date? = nil
 *      Days after maxDate are not selectable.
