// this gives me a way to collect all the data for an Item that i might want to edit
// (or even just display).  it defaults to having values appropriate for a new item upon
// creation, and can be initialized from a Item.  this is something
// i can then hand off to an edit view.  at some point, that edit view will
// want to update an Item with this data, so see the class function
// Item.update(using editableData: EditableItemData)

	// the id of the Item, if any, associated with this data collection
	// (nil if data for a new item that does not yet exist)
	var id: UUID? = nil
    
	// all of the values here provide suitable defaults for a new item

	// this copies all the editable data from an incoming Item.  this looks fairly
	// benign, but its in the lines below that crashes did/could occur in earlier versions
	// because of the main, underlying problem: if an item is deleted somewhere outside
	// a view showing a list of items, the list view may wind up calling this with an item
	// that's a zombie: the data behind it has been deleted, but it could still be present
	// as a fault in Core Data.  i still don't quite get this -- it's something to do
	// with how SwiftUI updates views and its interaction with a @FetchRequest.  this is the
	// one, remaining issue with SwiftUI i hope to understand real soon.
