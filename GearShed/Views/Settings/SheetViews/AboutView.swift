                 As a father-son combo with too much gear to manage, we were in search of an app that could help us organize our uncontrollable amount of gear. Unfortunatly we couldn't find one that met our expectations, so we decieded to build one.
                 
                 Me, the son, being a computer science student and tech wizard, set out to learn the SwiftUI programming language to bring our idea to life.
