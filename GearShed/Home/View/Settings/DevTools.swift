// what i previously called a "Dev Tools" tab -- now incorporated into the
// Preferences tab -- so that if you want to use this as a real app (device or simulator),
// access to all the debugging stuff can be displayed or not by setting this global
// variable `kShowDevTools`. for now, we'll show this on the simulator and not on a device.

// one of the things that has changed from release to release of XCode 12/iOS 14 is when
// the view modifiers .onAppear and .onDisappear are called.  so throughout the app, you
// find .onAppear and .onDisappear modifiers that print out when these actually do
// something by calling back to these two little functions.  you can turn this logging
// off by just commenting out the print statement (or deleting their calling from code).

// the code is essentially the same except for the typing of the objects
// in the list.  so we use the power of generics:  we introduce

// Codable (struct) representation of itself -- a proxy as it were.

// be able to produce a simple, Codable struct proxy holding only what we want to write out
